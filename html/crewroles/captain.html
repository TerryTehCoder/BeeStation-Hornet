	<h1>You are the Captain!</h1>
	<p><img src="captain.png"/></p>
	<p><b>Nanotrasen</b> has entrusted you to keep this station running well.</p>
	<p><b>You are <ins>not</ins> an antagonist, you are a head of staff.</b></p>
	<p>Your most important personal role is to secure the <ins><b>Nuclear Authentication Disk</b></ins> <img src="disk.png"/>found within your quarters.</p>
	<p>Giving the <b>Pinpointer</b> to another Head of Staff will assist in tracking you and the disk.</p>
	<p><img src="id_gold.png"/> Your ID card has access to every part of the station. While you may enter everywhere, try to use discretion with that power.</p>
	<p><img src="traitor.png"/>Threats to your crew and station may exist, but you are <b>not</b> a Security Officer. Allow them to be the station's first line of defense.</p>
	<p>Coordination with your <b>Heads of Staff</b> is key to running the station. Your headset has access to all channels should you enable them manually.</p>
	<p>Don't attempt to micromanage crew directly; delegate orders through <b>Heads of Staff</b> to the best of your ability.</p>	
	<p>Should the station situation become impossible to handle, you may use the <b><ins>Communication Console<ins></b> to call an <b>Emergency Shuttle</b>.</p>

	<p>Also using the <b><ins>Communication Console<ins></b>, you are the one member of the crew that can call an <b>Emergency Response Team</b> or contact <b>Central Command</b> in the event of emergency.</p>

	<p><b>Good luck, <i>Captain</i>, the Station is in your hands.</p>
